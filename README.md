# a basic SIR model programmed in rust

This project serves mostly my learning the rust programming language. But in order to do something interested I decided to use the SIR model as an example. SIR stands for "susceptible", "infected" and "removed". It is a system of coupled differential equations that are often used to model infectious diseases. Here the variables S+I+R=1 represent fractions of society. At the arrival of a new disease everybody is susceptible, so S is very near to 1, I is very small and R=0. The removed fraction consists of the recovered and/or dead people.
